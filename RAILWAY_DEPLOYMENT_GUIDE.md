- Your URL: `https://your-project-name-production.up.railway.app`
- **Copy this URL** for Next.js integration

## ‚úÖ Test Your Deployment

```bash
# Health check
curl https://your-project-name-production.up.railway.app/health

# Expected response:
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "PupRing AI Python Services"
}
```

## üí∞ Cost Management

### Typical Usage
- **AI Processing**: $0.10-0.50/day
- **Always Online**: No sleep charges
- **$5 Credit**: Covers 10-50 days
- **Monitor**: Railway dashboard shows real-time costs

### Cost Optimization Tips
```bash
# Reduce workers if needed
web: gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT --workers 1 --timeout 120 app:app

# Monitor memory usage in Railway dashboard
# Scale down if usage is low
```

## üîß Railway Dashboard Features

## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### Build Failures
```bash
# Check requirements.txt format
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Ensure app.py exists and is correct
python app.py  # Should start locally

# Check Railway build logs in dashboard
```

### High Memory Usage
```bash
# Reduce workers in Procfile:
web: gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT --workers 1 --timeout 120 app:app

# Monitor in Railway dashboard
# Consider upgrading plan if needed consistently
```

### Slow Performance
```bash
# Check Railway metrics for bottlenecks
# Consider adding more workers:
web: gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT --workers 3 --timeout 120 app:app

# Or upgrade to more RAM/CPU
```

## üîÑ Updates & Redeployment

```bash
# Make changes to your code
git add .
git commit -m "Update AI processing"
git push origin main

# Railway automatically redeploys!
# Watch progress in Railway dashboard
```

## üåê Integration with Next.js

Update your Next.js `.env` file:
```bash
PYTHON_SERVICE_URL=https://your-project-name-production.up.railway.app
PYTHON_API_URL=https://your-project-name-production.up.railway.app
NEXT_PUBLIC_PYTHON_API_URL=https://your-project-name-production.up.railway.app
```
